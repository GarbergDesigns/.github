## ðŸ—¿ Tech
We try to make use of the technology that best fits the need of the client website.

We use our own custom UI Component Library which uses PostCSS and TailwindCSS behind the scenes, this allows us to create completely custom react components.

Depending on the level of intereactivity you want in your website we would either use Next.JS which allows us to provide a more simply and secure user authentication system for use in onine shops for example, else we would use Deno Fresh which provides a simple just in time rendered webpage using island based client hydration. These are shipped with minimal javascript so the webpage loads to your users instantly no matter how slow their internet speed may be.
